Questions 1 and 2 can be run as batch scripts via q1batch.sh and q2batch.sh, however the path to the 
executables are specific to my system and would need to be adjusted. 

Both of those batch script run the code for several trials, as defined in the requirement for each problem.
The outputs are sent to several different files, and the outputs as found when I ran them can be found within
the submission. For problem 1, sub-folders are made to help organize these outputs

In addition, while q2 called for two implementations (tiled and untiled), both were provided in the same
code file, with an input argument to toggle which is done. The previously mentioned bash script tests both implementations.
