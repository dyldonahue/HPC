Each of question 1 and 2 have batch files that can be used ot run the executables in SLURM,
however the paths specified to the executables are unique to my directory structure, and would have
to be adjusted for the user's system

For quesion 2, though there are two parts, the code (and the batch file) are the same script, as the only
difference between them is the adjustment of a single macro

Inlcuded with the source files and batch scripts are the compiled executable (as refernces by the batch), 
and the output logs from running each scenario
